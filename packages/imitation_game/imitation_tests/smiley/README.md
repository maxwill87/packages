# Smiley

This test is an app that just draws one large image to the screen `smiley.png`,
stretched to fit inside the screen.

The following things are measured:

- 'startupTime' - The time between the start of the process and the rendering of
  the image to the screen.
- 'memory' - The amount of system memory the app is using after having rendered
  the image to the screen.
